<h2 id="simplerecipepluginforwordpress">Simple Recipe plugin for Wordpress</h2>

<p>Existing recipe plugins were overkill for what I needed, so I created this. It&#8217;s meant more for theme developers than end users, because it doesn&#8217;t include any front-end CSS.</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display the recipe with schema.org microdata</li>
<li>Ability to include multiple recipes in post/page</li>
<li>Control the location of the recipe within the content (which is why I&#8217;m using the shortcode method)</li>
<li>Keep things simple, with no added CSS or JS to the front end</li>
</ul>

<p>The plugin adds a &#8220;Recipe&#8221; custom post type and the &#8220;simple_recipe&#8221; shortcode.</p>

<p>The plugin outputs clean, unstyled, semantic HTML so it is up to the theme to create the look. I&#8217;ve added classes where appropriate to hook into for CSS.</p>

<h3 id="shortcodeusagenotes">Shortcode usage notes</h3>

<p>The shortcode has one required (&#8216;title&#8217;) and one optional (&#8216;show_thumb&#8217;, default is false) parameter right now, like so:</p>

<pre><code>[simple_recipe title=&quot;coconut-cinnamon-crumble&quot; show_thumb=true]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="recipecptnotes">Recipe CPT notes</h3>

<p>Recipe ingredients need to be entered as an unordered list.</p>

<p>Recipe instructions should be entered as an ordered list.</p>

<h4 id="todo:">To do:</h4>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;d like to create an easy way to insert the shortcode with the slug automatically. For now you have to know the recipe&#8217;s slug and the shortcode format and type it in manually</li>
<li>Field validation for inputs like &#8220;Prep Time&#8221;; these must be numeric input</li>
</ul>
